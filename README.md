Image to Speech Extension

Image to Speech is a Google Chrome extension that gives accurate descriptions of images in the web, in real time.

It was built in an hackathon and it's purpose is to help visually impaired people.

It integrates well with text-to-speech tools usually used by visually impaired people, such as JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver.

Some websites that run on top of HTTPS do not allow requests to non-HTTPS websites (facebook doesn't), so certificates are needed in order to run the extension properly.
